<div>
Notify projects consuming this builds Maven artifacts that there have been updates.  Works in tandem with the 'Build when Maven dependencies have been updated' trigger.

Other than the obvious use case where you'd like to build other projects that have a dependency on the current project, this can also be useful to split a long build process in to multiple stages (such as the build portion and the test portion).
